    <h1>Notifications: Keeping Users Informed</h1>

    <p>Timely and relevant notifications are crucial for a positive user experience. Our notification system is designed to keep users in the loop about the events that matter most to them, using the channels they prefer.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Twilio</h2>

    <p>We use Twilio as our communications backbone. Twilio is a robust and scalable platform that allows us to reliably send notifications across multiple channels:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>SMS:</strong> For urgent, time-sensitive alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>WhatsApp:</strong> For rich, interactive conversations and notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> For more detailed, non-urgent information and summaries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Notification Events</h2>

    <p>The system will automatically send notifications for the following key events:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>New Booking:</strong> A professional receives an alert when a client books their service.</li>
        <li><strong>Booking Confirmation:</strong> A client receives a confirmation once their payment is successful.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Service Completed:</strong> A notification is sent when a service is marked as complete, prompting the client to leave a review.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal Successful:</strong> A professional is notified when their withdrawal has been processed.</li>
    </ul>
