    <h1>Search: The Art of Discovery</h1>

    <p>Search is not just a feature; it's the core of the user experience. Our goal is to make finding the right service as intuitive and effortless as possible.</p>

    <h2>The Problem with Keywords</h2>

    <p>Traditional search engines rely on keywords. If a user searches for "website design," they will only find services that contain those exact words. This is a very limited approach. What if the user searches for "online store" or "e-commerce site"? A keyword-based search would miss these relevant results.</p>

    <h2>The Solution: Semantic Search</h2>

    <p>We use a technique called semantic search, which is powered by machine learning and vector embeddings. Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Essence of Meaning:</strong> When a user creates a service, we use a machine learning model to generate a vector embedding from the service description. This embedding is a list of numbers that represents the semantic meaning of the text.</li>
        <li><strong>The User's Intent:</strong> When a user types a search query, we generate an embedding for their query as well.</li>
        <li><strong>The Perfect Match:</strong> We then compare the user's query embedding to the embeddings of all the services in our database. The services with the most similar embeddings are the most relevant results.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Technology: pgvector</h2>

    <p>We use <code>pgvector</code>, a PostgreSQL extension that allows us to store and query vector embeddings directly in our database. This is a powerful and efficient way to implement semantic search.</p>

    <h2>The Result: A More Human-Centered Search</h2>

    <p>With semantic search, our users can find what they're looking for, even if they don't know the exact keywords to use. It's a more human-centered approach to search that leads to better results and a more satisfying user experience.</p>
