    <h1>Payments: The Engine of Commerce</h1>

    <p>Our payment system is designed to be secure, transparent, and fair to both clients and professionals.</p>

    <h2>The Foundation: Pagarme</h2>

    <p>We've partnered with Pagarme, a leading payment gateway in Brazil, to handle all of our payment processing. This allows us to offer a wide range of payment methods, including credit cards, Pix, and boleto, while ensuring the highest level of security.</p>

    <h2>The Escrow Model: A Circle of Trust</h2>

    <p>We use an escrow model to protect both parties in a transaction:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Commitment:</strong> When a client books a service, they pay the full amount to our platform. This shows that they are serious about the service and have the funds to pay for it.</li>
        <li><strong>The Safety Net:</strong> The funds are held in our Pagarme account until the service is completed. This gives the professional the confidence to start working, knowing that they will be paid.</li>
        <li><strong>The Reward:</strong> Once either the client or the professional notifies the platform that the service is complete, the funds are released to the professional's platform account, minus our service fee. These funds become available for withdrawal after a 15-day holding period to allow for dispute resolution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Withdrawal Process: Your Money, Your Way</h2>

    <p>We want to make it as easy as possible for our users to access their earnings.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>The Request:</strong> A user can request a withdrawal from their platform account at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>The Transfer:</strong> We process the request and transfer the funds to the user's registered bank account via the Pagarme API.</li>
        <li><strong>The Confirmation:</strong> The user receives a notification that the transfer is complete.</li>
    </ol>
