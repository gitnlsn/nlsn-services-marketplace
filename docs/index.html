    <h1>Welcome to the Marketplace Documentation</h1>

    <p>This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture, features, and flows of the peer-to-peer service marketplace.</p>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>

    <p>Our platform is a dynamic ecosystem where professionals can both showcase their skills and discover the services they need. It's a place for creators, artisans, and experts to connect, collaborate, and grow their businesses.</p>

    <h2>Core Pillars</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified User Model:</strong> Every user is both a potential client and a professional. There are no artificial barriers, just a single, flexible account.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Service Portfolios:</strong> Go beyond simple listings. Users can create beautiful, multi-page showcases for each of their services, complete with photo and video galleries.</li>
        <li><strong>Intuitive Discovery:</strong> We use cutting-edge semantic search to understand the <em>intent</em> behind a search, not just the keywords. This leads to more accurate and relevant matches.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure and Transparent Payments:</strong> Our Pagarme-powered escrow system protects both clients and professionals, ensuring a fair and trustworthy transaction process.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Channel Notifications:</strong> We keep users informed with timely alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, and email, powered by Twilio.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Communication:</strong> Professionals can choose to display their contact information publicly, allowing for direct communication with potential clients.</li>
    </ul>
