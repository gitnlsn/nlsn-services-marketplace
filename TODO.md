## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Using tRPC for type-safe API
- Prisma ORM for database
- NextAuth for authentication
- Pagarme for payments
- Tailwind + Shadcn/ui for styling

### Known Issues & Workarounds
1. Tests use mocks instead of real database
2. Map component dynamically imported to avoid SSR issues
3. Some TypeScript types need refinement
4. Test coverage needs significant improvement

### Future Considerations
- Mobile app development
- International expansion (multi-language)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- AI-powered service recommendations
- Video consultations feature
