    <h1>Services: Creation, Management, and Discovery</h1>

    <p>The "Services" section of our platform is the core marketplace where professionals showcase their expertise and clients find the solutions they need. This document outlines the comprehensive lifecycle of a service, from its initial creation by a professional to its sophisticated discovery by potential clients.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Creation and Enrichment</h2>
    <p>Professionals initiate the process by creating detailed service listings. This involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defining the Service:</strong> Providing a clear title and a comprehensive description that accurately conveys the scope, benefits, and deliverables of the service.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Pricing:</strong> Specifying the cost structure, whether it's a fixed price, hourly rate, or custom quote.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Portfolio:</strong> Uploading high-quality photos to visually represent their work and enhance the service's appeal.</li>
        <li><strong>Categorization:</strong> Assigning relevant categories and tags to improve initial discoverability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon creation, the platform processes the service description to generate a unique vector embedding. This embedding captures the semantic meaning of the service, enabling advanced search capabilities.</p>

    <h2>2. Service Management</h2>
    <p>Professionals maintain full control over their active and inactive service listings. Key management features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Editing:</strong> Updating descriptions, pricing, media, and other details as their offerings evolve.</li>
        <li><strong>Status Toggling:</strong> Activating or deactivating services based on availability or demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong> Accessing insights into service views, inquiries, and booking history.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Service Discovery (Semantic Search Integration)</h2>
    <p>Clients discover services primarily through our intuitive semantic search engine. This process leverages the vector embeddings generated during service creation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Query Embedding:</strong> When a client enters a search query, a vector embedding is generated for their query.</li>
        <li><strong>Similarity Matching:</strong> The platform compares the client's query embedding with the embeddings of all available services. Services with the highest semantic similarity are ranked higher.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Results:</strong> This approach ensures that clients find services that match the *intent* behind their search, even if exact keywords aren't used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Service Display and Engagement</h2>
    <p>Once discovered, services are presented to clients in an engaging and informative manner:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search Results:</strong> Concise cards summarizing key service details.</li>
        <li><strong>Professional Profiles:</strong> A dedicated section on the professional's profile showcasing all their active services.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Detail Pages:</strong> Comprehensive pages for each service, featuring full descriptions, media galleries, reviews, and a clear call-to-action (e.g., "Hire Now" or "Contact Professional").</li>
    </ul>
