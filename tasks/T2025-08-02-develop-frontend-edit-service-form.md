# Task: Develop frontend form for editing existing service listings

## Description
Develop the frontend form that allows professionals to edit their existing service listings. This form should pre-populate with the current service details and allow modifications to title, description, pricing, categories, and tags.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A dedicated frontend page/component for editing service listings exists.
*   The form is pre-populated with the data of the selected service.
*   The form includes input fields for:
    *   Service Title (text input)
    *   Service Description (textarea)
    *   Pricing (number input, with options for fixed, hourly, or custom quote)
    *   Categories (multi-select or dropdown, pre-defined list)
    *   Tags (text input with auto-completion or multi-select)
*   The form utilizes Shadcn UI components for a consistent look and feel.
*   Native HTML validation is implemented for all form fields.
*   The form is responsive and user-friendly across different screen sizes.
*   A mechanism to save changes is present (e.g., a submit button).

## Technical Notes

*   Fetch existing service data from the backend to pre-populate the form.
