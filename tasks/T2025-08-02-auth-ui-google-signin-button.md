# Task: Implement "Sign in with Google" button on the frontend

## Description

This task involves implementing a user-friendly "Sign in with Google" button on the frontend of the application. This button will serve as the primary entry point for users to authenticate and access the platform, leveraging NextAuth.js for the authentication flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   A clearly visible and clickable "Sign in with Google" button is present on the login/signup screen.
*   Clicking the button initiates the Google OAuth authentication flow.
*   The button's appearance and behavior are consistent with the overall design system of the application (e.g., Tailwind CSS styling).
*   No sensitive user information (e.g., Google credentials) is handled directly on the frontend.
*   Error handling is in place to gracefully manage authentication failures (e.g., network issues, Google API errors).

## Technical Details

*   **Location:** The button should be placed on the primary authentication screen (e.g., `src/app/page.tsx` or a dedicated login component).
*   **Framework:** Next.js with React.
*   **Authentication Library:** NextAuth.js `signIn` function.
*   **Styling:** Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling the button.

## Estimated Effort

*   Small to Medium

## Dependencies

*   NextAuth.js configuration on the backend (already documented).
*   Google API credentials configured for the application.

## Notes

*   Refer to the `docs/authentication.html` file for a detailed understanding of the authentication flow and NextAuth.js integration.
*   Ensure proper redirection after successful authentication.
