# Task: Implement filtering and categorization options for search results

## Description
Implement frontend UI elements and backend logic to allow users to filter and categorize search results. This will enhance the search experience by enabling users to narrow down results based on specific criteria.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   Frontend UI elements (e.g., checkboxes, dropdowns, sliders) are available on the Search Results Screen for filtering by:
    *   Categories
    *   Price range
    *   Rating (if applicable)
    *   Other relevant service attributes
*   Selecting filters updates the displayed search results dynamically.
*   Backend search endpoint is updated to accept and apply filtering and categorization parameters.
*   The filtering and categorization UI adheres to Shadcn UI styling and native HTML validation principles.

## Technical Notes
*   Utilize Shadcn UI components for filter controls (e.g., `Checkbox`, `Select`, `Slider`).
*   Implement state management for selected filters on the frontend.
*   Modify the backend search tRPC procedure to incorporate filtering logic into Prisma queries.
*   Consider performance implications of complex filter combinations on database queries.
