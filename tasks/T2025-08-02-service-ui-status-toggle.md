# Task: Implement functionality to activate/deactivate services on the frontend

## Description
Implement the frontend functionality that allows professionals to activate or deactivate their service listings. This could be a toggle switch or a button on the service management screen.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A clear UI element (e.g., toggle, button) is available for each service listing to change its active/inactive status.
*   Changing the status provides immediate visual feedback to the user.
*   The UI element is integrated with the backend API to persist the status change.
*   The functionality adheres to Shadcn UI styling and native HTML validation principles (if applicable to a form submission).

## Technical Notes
*   Utilize Shadcn UI components for the toggle or button.
*   Implement a client-side function to call the backend API for status updates.
*   Consider optimistic UI updates for a smoother user experience.
