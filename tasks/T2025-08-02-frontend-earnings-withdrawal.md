# Task: Develop frontend interface for professionals to view earnings and request withdrawals

## Description
Develop the frontend interface that allows professionals to view their accumulated earnings and initiate withdrawal requests. This screen should clearly display their current balance, transaction history, and a form for requesting a payout.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   A dedicated "Earnings & Withdrawal" screen is accessible for authenticated professionals.
*   The screen displays the professional's current available balance.
*   A history of earnings and past withdrawals is presented.
*   A form is available for professionals to request a withdrawal, specifying the amount.
*   The interface utilizes Shadcn UI components for a consistent look and feel.
*   Native HTML validation is implemented for the withdrawal request form (e.g., minimum withdrawal amount, valid bank details).

## Technical Notes
*   Implement client-side functions to fetch earnings data and submit withdrawal requests to the backend.
*   Utilize Shadcn UI components for displaying financial data and form inputs.
*   Consider real-time updates for the available balance.
*   Ensure sensitive bank account information is handled securely and not stored on the frontend.
